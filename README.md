## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quests.cr
cd quests.cr
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
shards install
```

3. Build the application:
```bash
shards build
```

4. Run:
```bash
./bin/quests
```

### As a Dependency

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  quests:
    github: your-username/quests.cr
```

Then run:
```bash
shards install
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Run the application (saves to quests.txt)
quests

# Run in daily quests mode (saves to daily-quests-YYYY-MM-DD.txt)
quests --daily

# Show help
quests --help

# Show version
quests --version
```

### Navigation Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `‚Üì` | Move down |
| `k` / `‚Üë` | Move up |
| `a` | Add new quest |
| `d` | Delete selected quest |
| `x` | Toggle quest completion |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save quests to file |
| `w` | Save as (save with new filename) |
| `Tab` | Switch between quest list and files |
| `Enter` | Save quest (when adding) / Load file (in files view) |
| `Escape` | Cancel (when adding quest / save as) |
| `q` | Quit application (prompts to save if unsaved changes) |

### File Format

Quests are saved in a simple text format:

```
# Quests saved at 2024-01-15 14:30:25

[ ] Buy groceries
[‚úì] Learn Crystal programming
[ ] Build quest tracker
[‚úì] Add file saving feature
```

#### File Naming

- **Regular mode**: `quests.txt` (overwrites each save)
- **Daily mode** (`--daily`): `daily-quests-YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (one file per day)
- **Save As**: Custom filename with `.txt` extension automatically added

#### Unsaved Changes

The application tracks unsaved changes and provides helpful prompts:

- **Visual indicator**: Window title shows `*` when there are unsaved changes (e.g., "Quests *")
- **Save prompt**: When quitting with unsaved changes, you'll get options to:
  - `s` - Save and quit
  - `y` - Quit without saving
  - `n` - Cancel and return to the app
- **Auto-tracking**: Changes are automatically detected when adding, deleting, or completing quests

### As a Library

```crystal
require "quests"

# Create a new quest
quest = Quests::Quest.new("Learn Crystal programming")
puts quest.completed  # => false

# Mark as completed
quest.complete!
puts quest.completed  # => true

# Create and run the app
app = Quests::App.new
app.run
```
